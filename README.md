# Recipes for Disaster
An iOS app designed for adventurous foodies who aren't afraid to experiment in the kitchen!

### Running the Project
Clone the repo and open the Xcode Project. The iPhone 15 Simulator is suggested.

### Project Structure
- Views : All the SwiftUI Views and View "Props" for the app
- ViewModels : The view models to power the Views. Each top level view that does data syncing should have a view model.
- MealsAPI: The MealsAPI Client and data models.
- Persistence: The CoreData storage and queries of the MealsAP
- Utils : When you need a little extra push.
